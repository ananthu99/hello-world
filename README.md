# hello-world
Hi, I am Anand Balasubramanian and this is My First Github repository - created on June 20th 2016 - the day of the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.

It's time to move back into coding - slowly but surely and GitHub knowledge is very important for that.

I have not done any major coding in the last 5 plus years and so I am hoping to get back into it soon - but, it will take some time to being productive in it again.

Cheers,
Anand.
